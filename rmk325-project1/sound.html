          <p>Over the past two years, I have developed a passion for audio engineering and sound design. Much of my spare time is spent working on mixes, researching more information, and exploring new products and techniques. To further my interests, I completed a course at Cornell and supplemental courses at New York University, where I vastly expanded my skillset and worked with professionals in the field on mixing projects. I have additionally worked on my own projects and have developed skills through experimentation.</p>

          <h4>Experience</h4>

          <p>Much of my experience has been through completing independent projects. For my classes at NYU, I mixed songs in a variety of genres, from electronic music to RnB to heavy metal to alternative. I additionally have experience mixing scores, dialogue, and sound effects for video.

          Additionally, this semester I am taking on a Mix Engineering position at Electric Buffalo Records and will be taking on a Disc Jockey position at 93.5 WVBR-FM.</p>
